Division theme for bolt
----------------------

This is the "Division" theme for bolt, built upon a variation of the same flex grid that Base-2016 is built upon. It is very minimalistic, and only supplies three main twig files by default.

**Note:**  This is for Bolt 3. Check out the `bolt-v2` branch for a Bolt 2 compatible version.
